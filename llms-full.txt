`any-guardrail` is a Python library providing a single interface to different guardrails.

### Getting Started

Refer to the [Quickstart](#./quickstart.md) for instructions on installation and usage.

### Guardrails

Refer to [Guardrails](#./api/guardrails.md) for the parameters for each guardrail.

Refer to [GuardrailFactory](#./api/guardrail_factory.md) for how to use the `GuardrailFactory` object.

## For AI Systems

### Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer

### Installation

Install with `pip`:

```bash
pip install any-guardrail
```

### Basic Usage

`GuardrailFactory` provides a seamless interface for interacting with the guardrail models. It allows you to see a list of all the supported guardrails, and to instantiate each supported guardrails. Here is a full example:

```python
from any_guardrail import GuardrailFactory
supported_guardrails = GuardrailFactory.list_all_supported_guardrails() # This will out a list of all guardrail identifiers
guardrail = GuardrailFactory.create_guardrail(support_guardrails[0])  # will create Deepset's deberta prompt injection defense model
result = guardrail.safety_review("All smiles from me!")
assert result.unsafe == False
```

We have an example notebook as well in `examples/Testing.ipynb`.

### Troubleshooting

Some of the models on HuggingFace require extra permissions to use. To do this, you'll need to create a HuggingFace profile and manually go through the permissions. Then, you'll need to download the HuggingFace Hub and login. One way to do this is:

```bash
pip install --upgrade huggingface_hub

hf auth login
```
